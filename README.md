# Intelligent-Space
The objective of this project was to develop MATLAB/Simulink code to control four Lego Mindstorms EV3s. The EV3s were designed and built for maximum efficiency with ease of building to ensure consistent, quality performances. After the EV3s were built, Simulink code was developed after numerous iterations to control, manipulate, and monitor the EV3s. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) was written and coded with MATLABâ€™s AppDesigner tool to allow users to wirelessly change what the Simulink program is doing via WIFI communication. OptiTrack was utilized in the Simulink and GUI programs to allow for EV3 location monitoring, parking, and finding the shortest path. Multiple forms of analyses were conducted on the project to given reasoning behind decisions as well as open discussions for future improvements to the systems used.
